AES encryption|<firstterm>Advanced Encryption Standard</firstterm> - very fast and secure; the de facto standard for symmetric encryption.|zlib compression
Backing image|A (typically) read-only disk image which can be used as a starting point for new read-write images.|Snapshot
Base-image|Placeholder.|Backing image,Snapshot
Device map|Software which creates devices from partition tables which you can interact with|Partition table,kpartx,GParted,Partition
GParted|A graphical application used for manipulating (creating, resizing, moving, copying) the filesystems of partitions.|
Guest OS|An operating system which is installed and ran on emulatd, virtual, or paravirtual hardware which is managed by hypervisor software on the Host OS.|Hypervisor,Host OS
Host OS|The running system (server, OS) which provides resources and facilities for running several virtual Guest Operating Systems.|Guest OS
Hypervisor|Software blabla.|
Image|A file which virtualization software can use as a hard disk, similar to a snapshot.|
OS|Short for <firstterm>Operating System</firstterm>.|
Partition table|Meta-data stored on a storage volume which describes the partition layout, i.e., begin/end locations, types, and other properties.|Device map,kpartx,GParted,Partition,meta-data
Partition|In storage devices, the definition of storage allocation on a device; the capacity of that region is less than or equal to that of the backing storage device; multiple partitions may exist.|
QCOW2|<firstterm>QEMY Copy On Write</firstterm> image format (version 2); improves v1 with few features: snapshots, performance tuning options.|
QCOW|<firstterm>QEMU Copy On Write</firstterm> image format (version 1); supports sparse files, backing files, and encryption.|
RAW|The simplest type of virtual disk format, as the file contains no extra meta-data about itself, often usable without requiring special software.|QCOW,QCOW2,meta-data
Snapshot|An virtual disk feature representing a moment in time, not represented as a disk image.|Backing image,Base-image
kpartx|Reads partition tables on a specified device and create device maps over partition segments detected|Partition
ls|A command which lists directory contents and file attributes.|
meta-data|Data which describes other data; e.g., virtual disk configuration parameters.|
qemu-img|Virtual disk manipulation tool bundled with the QEMU (Quick Emulator) software collection.|
