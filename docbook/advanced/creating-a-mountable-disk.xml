  <title>Creating a Mountable Disk</title>

  <para>
    In the previous section I went through creating a disk that you
    can use as the boot disk for a virtual machine. In that example
    it was expected that you would configure your virtualization
    software to use that disk and then the operating system
    installation would take care of creating the disk label and file
    systems. In this section I'll show you the steps required to do
    that by yourself.
