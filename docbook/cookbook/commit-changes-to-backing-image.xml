  <title>Comitting changes to a backing image</title>

  <para>
    Sometimes we would want to update a base-image to resemble the
    contents of an attached COW image. Maybe we wanted to make the
    latest system updates a part of the base image, or a configuration
    setting needed to be updated. This was as simple as making the
    base-image read-write, and running <command>qemu-img
    commit</command> on the created file.

    <para>
      You should turn off or suspend the virtual machine when running
      the <command>commit</command> command. Failure to do so could
      result in data corruption.
