    <title>Convert an Image from RAW to QCOW2</title>

    <para>
      RAW images, though simple to work with, carry the disadvantage
      of increased disk usage on the host OS. One option we have is to
      convert the image into the QCOW2 format which uses
      zlib<footnote><para>From the zlib homepage (<link
      xl:href="http://zlib.net/"/>): zlib is designed to be a free,
      general-purpose, legally unencumbered &#x2014; that is, not
      covered by any patents &#x2014; lossless data-compression
      library for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating
      system.</para></footnote> compression and optionally allows your
      disks to be secured with 128 bit AES
      encryption<footnote><para>For more information on AES
      encryption, see <citetitle>FIPS PUB 197: Advanced Encryption

      <remark>TODO: Explain how QCOW2 only uses as much space as there
      is data in the image. Also talk about sparse file
      systems</remark>

      Here's how to do the last example, but in reverse.

    <note>
      <para>
	When converted to the RAW format the image has the potential
	to take up much more disk space than before. RAW images may
	use up up their allocated space immediately, whereas QCOW
	images will grow to their pre-determined maximum size over
	time.
