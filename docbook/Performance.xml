  <title>Performance Considerations</title>

  <para>
    Managing disk images doesn't stop at file maniplation and storage
    pool monitoring. After you create a disk image something else is
    going to use it. That's where performance tuning considerations
    come into play. This section straddles the line between system
    administrator and application developer roles. What I mean to say
    is that application of some techniques in this section may require
    knowledge which is outside of your domain as a system
    administrator. To help bridge the knowledge gap I'll include notes
    on how to identify what you're looking for when tuning the system.
