  <title>Write-through Caching</title>

  <para>
    Write-through caching means that modified data is written
    synchronously into both system cache, as well as a backing store
    (RAM/disk drive). Because the writing happens in the backing store
    as well, write-through cache introduces a performance hit.

  <para>
    Because write-through caching puts a larger load on the host it is
    best used in moderation. You should avoid enabling write-through
    caching on a host with many guests, as this configuration is prone
    to scaling issues. You should only consider enabling write-through
    caching in situations where data integrity is paramount above all
    else or where write-back caching is not available on the guest.
