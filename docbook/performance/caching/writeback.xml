  <title>Write-back Caching</title>

  <para>
    Write-back caching means that as I/O from the virtual guest
    happens it is reported as <firstterm>complete</firstterm> as soon
    as the data is in the virtual hosts page cache<footnote

  </para>

  <para>
    I remember the phrase write-back by thinking of it like this:
    <quote>As soon as a <firstterm>write</firstterm> happens on the
    guest a response is sent <emphasis>back</emphasis> to indicate
    that the operation has <quote>completeted</quote>.</quote>
  </para>

  <para>
    Using write-back caching will have several side-affects:

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>PRO: Increased performance</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Both the guest and host will experience increased I/O
	    performance due to the lazy nature of cache-writes.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>CON: Increased risk of corruption</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Until the data is <function>flush</function>'d there is an
	    increased risk of data corruption/loss due to the volatile
	    properties of system cache.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>CON: Doesn't support guest migrations</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You can not use the guest migration hypervisor feature if
	    you are using write-back cache mode.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>CON: Not supported by all Operating Systems</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Not all OSs may support write-back cache. For example,
	    RHEL releases prior to 5.6<footnote><para><link
	    xl:href="https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Tuning_and_Optimization_Guide/chap-Virtualization_Tuning_Optimization_Guide-BlockIO.html"/>.</para></footnote>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
  </para>

  <para>
    In reality, write-back is not as dangerous as it may appear to be,
    though the CONs out-number the PROs. The QEMU User
    Documentation<footnoteref linkend="QEMU-User-Docs-invocation"/>
    says the following:
  </para>

  <blockquote>
    <para>
      By default, the <literal>cache=writeback</literal> mode is
      used. It will report data writes as completed as soon as the
      data is present in the host page cache. This is safe as long as
      your guest OS makes sure to correctly flush disk caches where
      needed. If your guest OS does not handle volatile disk write
      caches correctly and your host crashes or loses power, then the
      guest may experience data corruption.
    </para>
  </blockquote>

  <para>
    If your guest is ineligable for the <quote>none</quote> mode,
    because it doesn't manage its disk write cache well, then
    write-back mode is a great secondary option.
  </para>
