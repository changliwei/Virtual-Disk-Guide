      This tool allows you to discover filesystems, partitions,
      logical volumes, and their sizes in a disk image or virtual
      machine.

    <command>virt-filesystems</command> is the <command>df</command>
    of virtual disk management. Minus the part that tells you how much
    of a disk is actually used. What delights me most about
    <command>virt-filesystems</command> is how well it integrates with
    <acronym>LVM</acronym> (Logical Volume Manager) to show you LVM
    device paths. This tool is most useful in combination with other
    tools, such as virt-resize, virt-sparsify, or guestmount.
