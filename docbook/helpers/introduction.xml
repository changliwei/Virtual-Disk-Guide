  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
    Up until now most of the commands we've been using have been very
    low-level. Just the section on resizing images

    <footnote><para><xref linkend="VDG-Cookbook-Resize-Image" /></para></footnote>

    is about 8 pages of this book (depending on what format you're
    reading it in). Lets get real here: it's not pragmatic to run ten
    commands when one or two will suffice. Luckily for us some very
    helpful utilities exist.
  </para>

  <para>
    This section will introduce those utilities. I'll highlight some
    key features in each, show demos, and tell you where you can find
    more information. Lets get started by introducing our new heros
    using their official descriptions.

          <systemitem class="library">libguestfs</systemitem> is a way
          to create, access and modify disk images. You can look
          inside disk images, modify the files they contain, create
          them from scratch, resize them, and much more. It's
          especially useful from scripts and programs and from the
          command line.

          The <quote>Virtual Machine Manager</quote> application
          (<application>virt-manager</application> for short package
          name) is a desktop user interface for managing virtual
          machines. It presents a summary view of running domains,
          their live performance &amp; resource utilization
          statistics. The detailed view graphs performance &amp;
          utilization over time. Wizards enable the creation of new
          domains, and configuration &amp; adjustment of a domain's
          resource allocation &amp; virtual hardware. An embedded VNC
          client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest
          domain.
