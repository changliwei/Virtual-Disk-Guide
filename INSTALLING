Notes on installing the necessary items for building this document:

- Unfortunately the upstream dblatex header/footer LaTeX style file
  must be modified.

  - cp latex/dbk_headfoot.sty /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/dblatex/dbk_headfoot.sty


- Install the Adobe Source Code Pro/Source Sans Pro fonts *.ttf files in ~/.fonts/

#######

There is a setup-docbook.sh script which can do most of the above steps for you.

#######


- Copy the dblatex styles into ~/.dblatex

  $ cp -r notes/.dblatex ~/
